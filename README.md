- Built structure to develop a more complex addon further down the line
- Code more user-friendly (less gibberish)

### Version 2.1.2:
- Fixed bug with Blender 3.6.2++
- To bake multiple different objects, just select them, while clicking the Emitter active and click bake

### Version 2.0:

## Examples
See it live at [SketchFab](https://skfb.ly/o9RPG)

### Bake Particles into Keyframed Objects
This feature creates a new collection with your particle objects in it. Useful for:
- Drive the motion of a storm of objects with particles
- Transfer the motion from particles to any object in blender
- Export simulations as .fbxs
- Fluid Simulations
- Explosion Simulations (Particle System)
- Particles Export into .fbx files

## Troubleshooting:
People reported problems when updating to Blender 4.0++
If you also can´t see the addon when installing the .zip file just unzip the file and install the .py file directly from the add-on prefences tab.

Developed for Blender 3.0+, but it should work on previous versions as well. Ignore the warning message during installation.
