"Cake Particles would've not been possible without a Big Help from @Joshua and all the Developers that Posted their Answers at these Links in the Past https://tiny.one/StackExchange https://tiny.one/BartSketchfab"

-Cake Particles is an Addon for Blender that lets you Bake your Particles Simulations into Keyframed Objects.

The Goal is to Simplify some Routines to let People create even more Complex .fbx files with just a few Clicks.

It can also be useful to Incentivate the Built-in Quick Effects and Alembic workflows in Blender.

The Addon is located into the Object Properties for all those People like me that can't read shit when Pressing N.

Here you can Find all the Documentation about the Addon https://sites.google.com/view/cakeparticlesdocs/home-page.

It was Developed for 3.0 but it should Be fine working on Previous Versions too, 
just Ignore the Message you Get when Installing it.
